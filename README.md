# Employee-Exit-Surveys
Cleaning data and analyzing

In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of
Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE)
institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey here
(https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?
q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE here (https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qldfe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

In this project, we'll try to answer the following questions:
+ Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to
some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
+ Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older
employees?

We will combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. 
Let's start by reading in the datasets and exploring them.
